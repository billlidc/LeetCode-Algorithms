# [2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-players-into-teams-of-equal-skill)

Note: The solution is clever by first sorting the array and comparing each of the two pairs (the weakest available player and the strongest available player).

```java
class Solution {
    public long dividePlayers(int[] skill) {
        Arrays.sort(skill);
        int l = 0, r = skill.length - 1;
        int goal = skill[l] + skill[r];
        
        long ans = 0;
        while (l < r) {
            if (skill[l] + skill[r] != goal) {
                return (long) -1;
            } else {
                ans += skill[l] * skill[r];
            }
            l++; r--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
