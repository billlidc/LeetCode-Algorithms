# [453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements)

Explanation: Incrementing `n - 1` elements by 1 is equivalent to decrementing one element by 1 to make all elements equal. Therefore, to minimize the number of moves, we need to bring all elements down to the minimum element in the array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int min = nums[0];
        int diff = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            diff += Math.abs(n - min);
        }
        return diff;
    }
}
```
