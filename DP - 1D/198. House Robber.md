Note:
- `prev`: This variable keeps track of the maximum amount of money robbed from all houses up to the house before the previous house. Initially set to 0.
- `curr`: This variable keeps track of the maximum amount of money robbed from all houses up to the previous house. Initially set to 0.


```java
public class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int prev = 0, curr = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int temp = Math.max(nums[i] + prev, curr); // Robbing the current house i
            prev = curr;
            curr = temp;
        }
        return curr;
    }
}
