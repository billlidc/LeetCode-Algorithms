# Exercise 02

## Adorable Strings

We consider a string consisting of one or more lowercase English alphabetic letters ([a-z]), digits ([0-9]), colons (`:`), forward slashes (`/`), and backward slashes (`\`) to be **adorable** if the following conditions are satisfied:

    The first letter of the string is a lowercase English letter.
    Next, it contains a sequence of zero or more of the following characters: lowercase English letters, digits, and colons.
    Next, it contains a forward slash.
    Next, it contains a sequence of one or more of the following characters: lowercase English letters and digits.
    Finally, it ends with a backward slash.
    Complete the adorable_regex string in the editor window. It should match exactly those strings which are adorable.

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class Adorable {
    public static String adorable_regex = "^[a-z][a-z0-9:]*\\/[a-z0-9]+\\\\$";

    public static String isAdorable(String s) {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(Adorable.adorable_regex);
        return pattern.matcher(s).find() ? "adorable" : "despicable";
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
- `[a-z]` ensures the string starts with a lowercase English letter.
- `[a-z0-9:]*` allows zero or more lowercase English letters, digits, or colons.
- `/` matches the forward slash.
- `[a-z0-9]+` requires one or more lowercase English letters or digits.
- `\\\\$` matches a single backward slash (escaped as \\\\ in Java) at the end of the string ($ asserts the position at the end).
