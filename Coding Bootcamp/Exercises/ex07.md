# Exercise 07

## Concepts

> What is the runtime complexity of the following function in terms of its last parameter, `n`? Function `g(a, m)` has complexity $O(m)$.

```java
int f(int[] a, int n) {
   if (n <= 0) return 0;
   return g(a, n) + f(a, n - 1);
}
```

> Recurrence Relation: `T(n) = O(n) + T(n − 1)`


```
T(n) = O(n) + T(n − 1)
     = O(n) + O(n - 1) + T(n − 2)
     = O(n) + O(n - 1) + ... + O(1)
     = O(n + (n - 1) + ... + 1)
     = O(n * (n + 1) / 2)
     = O(n^2)
```


## Planking the Walk

**Planking the Walk**: You are given an unlimited supply of wooden boards whose lengths are integer multiples of 1 meter ranging from `min` to `max` (e.g., if `min=2` and `max=4`, you will have lengths 2, 3, and 4 meters). Using those boards, you need to construct a walking path through a flower bed which is `N` meters long by putting boards end-to-end. How many different combinations of boards add up to a length of `N` meters?

For example, if `N=5`, `min=1`, and `max=3`, you could use the following board lengths, in order:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2
1 1 2 1
1 2 1 1
2 1 1 1
1 2 2
2 1 2
2 2 1
1 1 3
1 3 1
3 1 1
2 3
3 2
```

for a solution of 13.

You quickly realize that the recurrence relation for this problem is (in part): `combinations(n) = combinations(n-min) + ... + combinations(n-max)` because you could either add a `min`-meter board to any combination that adds up to `N-min` meters, a `max`-meter board to any combination that adds up to `N-max` meters, or any corresponding values between `min` and `max`. Complete the function `combinations`, which takes the length `N` and `min/max` as input and returns a long with the number of combinations.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PlankWalk {
    static long combinations(int N, int min, int max) {
      long[] memo = new long[N + 1];


      // Base case
      memo[0] = 1;


      // Fill in values
      for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        memo[i] = 0;
        for (int j = min; j <= max; j++) {
          if (i >= j) {
            memo[i] += memo[i - j];
          } 
        }
      }

      return memo[N];
    }

    // for Code Visualizer
    public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println(combinations(5,1,3));
    }
}
```
