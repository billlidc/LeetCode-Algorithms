# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self)

Note: The algorithm effectively computes the product of all elements except the current one for each position in the array without using vision. It does this by leveraging two passes over the array: one to calculate the product of all elements to the left and another to calculate the product of all elements to the right. This approach ensures an optimal time complexity of `O(n)` and uses `O(1)` extra space (excluding the output array).

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        
        // First pass: calculate left products
        for (int i = 0, left = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            answer[i] = left;
            left *= nums[i];
        }
        
        // Second pass: calculate right products and final result
        for (int i = n - 1, right = 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            answer[i] *= right;
            right *= nums[i];
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
