# Java Concepts

## OOP

### Definition

> **OOP** is a programming paradigm where concepts are organized around objects that represent real-world entities.

### Core OOP Principles

1. **Encapsulation** (using `private` access modifier, and accessing fields via getters and setters)

2. **Abstraction** (achieved through `abstract` classes or interfaces to hide implementation details)

3. **Inheritance** (utilizing `extends` to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class)

4. **Polymorphism**

   - **Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading):** When a class contains multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or counts.

   - **Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding):** When a subclass provides a specialized implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
